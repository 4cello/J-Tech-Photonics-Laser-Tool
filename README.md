# J-Tech-Photonics-Laser-Tool

For now, this is the new official home for the JTech laser cutting Inskape extension.
The latest version of the extension is compatible with both Inskape 0.9 and Inscape 1.0 by changing the "target_version" variable. A better approach is in the works.

More documentation coming soon, in the meantinÃ¬me you can refer to JTP's official website (the previous home for the extension).

Note: Pull requests are welcome, just make sure to test your code on both Python >=2.6 and >=3.5.
